## Future Things?

2. Give Khorne marked pawns special abilities that grows stronger the more they've killed. (Genes Module)
3. Special effect for daemon ressurection and summoning. (Genes and Psycast Module)

## Ideas
1. Wounded space marine drop pod - for genes acqusition (Genes Module)
2. Make Imperium faction use different chapter armor for different raids. (Faction Module)
3. Mechinator stuff, servo skulls (New module)

## Fixes to do
1. Psytrainer quest reward giving access to paths without psyker gene. (VPE thing, need to look into code and harmony fix it?) (Psycast Module)
2. Patch for immortals mod when person is afflitced with nurgles rot (Psycast Module)
3. Marines called using favor doesnt have the correct xenotype (Make a new callaid method that applies the genes after spawning the pawn) (Faction Module)
4. Marine can show up as slaves, they shouldnt (Faction Module)

## New Module Ideas
1. Chaos Module (Currently Making)
    1. Make more chaos genes, like tentacle of tzeentch or mouth of nurgle, make them work on the ritual system. Maybe a random chance to get a beneficial mutation or a bad one.
    2. Nervous breakdown may cause chaos to notice and offer "gifts"

2. Techpriest Module
    1. Make new mechinator machines such as servo skulls

3. Ideology module
    1. Expand on current ideology for faction module. Essentially ripping it out and making a new mod out of it. This would include new roles such as apothecary, whom is the only one who can do mecidal procedure to remove geneseed after they've grown. Also should be able to harvest geneseeds from dead marines.
