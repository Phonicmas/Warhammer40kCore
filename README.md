# Warhammer 40k Series for Rimworld

## Future Things?
1. Make mod split into submods so people can pick a choose what they want (Genes, Psycast, Faction)

## To do (Not ordered)
1. Make greater daemon sprites for all gods. (Psycast Module)
2. Give Khorne marked pawns special abilities that grows stronger the more they've killed. (Genes Module)
3. Special effect for daemon ressurection and summoning. (Genes and Psycast Module)

## Ideas
1. Wounded space marine drop pod - for genes acqusition (Genes Module)
2. Complete gene drop pod - archmagus misplaced these (Genes Module)
3. Make more chaos genes, like tentacle of tzeentch or mouth of nurgle, make them work on the ritual system. Maybe a random chance to get a beneficial mutation or a bad one. (New Module)
4. Nervous breakdown may cause chaos to notice and do stuff? (New Module - same as above)
5. Harvest psychic potential from dead psykers to upgrade other psychic powers. (Genes Module)
6. Add guardsmen to imperial faction that are then patched to use Grimworld Hammer of imperium guardsmen armor. (Faction Module)
7. Make Imperium faction use different chapter armor. (Faction Module)

## Fixes to do
1. Psytrainer quest reward giving access to paths without psyker gene. (VPE thing, need to look into code and harmony fix it?) (Psycast Module)
2. imperium faction quests not showing up properly for some? (Faction Module)
3. Patch for immortals mod when person is afflitced with nurgles rot (Psycast Module)
4. Marines called using favor doesnt have the correct xenotype (Faction Module)
